Feedback:

Pros of class:

- hands-on assignments / learning by doing
- Working in randomized pairs throughout the semester so far has really helped me get to know my classmates and share knowledge with each other.
- I like the partner activities... when we actually get to do them in class together. The independent ones don't feel like I am learning as much.

Could be improved:

- Pairing MIDS people with non MIDS people can be quite tough as non MIDS people have different availability and may have different working styles that can start to be detrimental rather than useful especially when the differences create a communication barrier with your randomly assigned pair and you have a hard time working with them.
