    "\n",
    "In this data, you will find a column called \"Address\" with the addresses of each polling place. Unfortunately, an address -- saved as a string -- is not valid geospatial data, so we need to find a way to convert these addresses into latitudes and longitudes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of converting addresses into latitude and longitude is called *geocoding*, and can be done in a number of different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're willing to spend a little bit of money, my own favorite tool is [geocod.io](https://www.geocod.io/) -- upload a spreadsheet of addresses, and they will geocode them at a very reasonable price (all the polling places in North Carolina for a year costs about $1.50), and you can also get data attached to your spreadsheet like information from the U.S. Census for a little bit extra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use the [geocode tool in geopandas](https://geopandas.org/docs/user_guide/geocoding.html) to geocode addresses programmatically. The only limitation is that services that do geocoding are usually either quite limited in the number of addresses you can query per day, require an account code, or for some, both. Note that tool requires installing `geopy`, an optional geopandas dependency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use this tool to geocode 20 of your polling place addresses (take a random sample) using `provider=\"ArcGIS\"`. Note this may take a while, as photon is rate-limited (it only accepts queries coming in so fast). ArcGIS is only free for a few queries, so we don't wanna get booted by getting greedy. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that if you're trying to do this in a classroom, the geocoding service may not be able to distinguish between different students with the same IP address so this may fail miserably. ðŸ¤£)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `.plot()` to plot the resulting data. \n",
    "\n",
    "This geocode tool actually supports LOTS of [geocoders](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#module-geopy.geocoders), and while most of them aren't free, if you were doing this professionally you could get an API key to any of them to make this work with, say, google maps, or geocod.io for pretty cheap. \n"
