As a result, there are several sets of methods that do very similar things, and which can be hard to keep straights:</p> <ul class=simple > <li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >melt</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >pivot</span></code>: Tools for moving a dataset from long-to-wide (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >pivot</span></code>) or wide-to-long (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >melt</span></code>).</p> <li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >pivot_table</span></code>: Like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >pivot</span></code>, but allows for aggregations if you want.</p> <li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >stack</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >unstack</span></code>: Like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >melt</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >pivot</span></code>, but only for use when your variables are stored in indices. I don’t use these much.</p> </ul> <p>Personally, <strong>I find melt and pivot most useful.</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >pivot_table</span></code> <em>can</em> do aggregations, but you can always de aggregations yourself using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >groupby</span></code>. :)</p> <p>Also, I have to go look at <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html">these pictures</a>… every time I reshape. Don’t hesistate to look them up for help!</p> <p><strong>What SHOULD I want my data to look like?</strong> Just a reminder that a natural question to ask is “in what format should I want my data?” Obviously this question is subjective, but as you read in the Hadley Wickham <a class="reference external" href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html">piece I assigned</a>, this is a good standard definition for a “tidy” dataset to which we might aspire:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li><p>Each variable forms a column.</p> <li><p>Each observation forms a row.</p> <li><p>Each type of observational unit forms a table.</p> </ol> <p>In general, I’m a big fan of this approach, and I think it’s a good one to use (especially numbers 1 and 2).</p> <p>Note that the question of what forms an “observation” depends on the analysis you plan to run (which depends on the answer you seek to ask! See! EVERYTHING ALWAYS COMES BACK TO THE QUESTION YOU ARE SEEKING TO ANSWER!). Suppose you have data on GDP from different countries for many years. If you plan to run a panel analysis where each observation is a country-year, then each row should be a country-year. But if you plan to do a country-level analysis using measures of, say, GDP variation over time, then each row should be a country!</p> <section id=Gradescope-Autograding > <h2 id=Gradescope-Autograding >Gradescope Autograding<a class=headerlink  href="#Gradescope-Autograding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2> <p>This assignment will be autograded using the same autograder we have used for our past several exercises.

So before anything else, thin down your dataset by getting only the rows related to:</p> <ul class=simple > <li><p>GDP per capita (in Constant US Dollars – the “constant” means values are have been adjusted for inflation, so values from 1970 can be directly compared with 2010)</p> <li><p>Gini coefficient</p> <li><p>Information on income shares (what percentage of total income goes to X% of the income distribution). <strong>There are 7 of these in total.</strong></p> </ul> <p>Store the number of rows you get from this updated dataset in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >ex2_num_rows</span></code>.</p> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this is non-trivial. This is a big dataset with LOTS of variables, so you’ll have to use your data wrangling skills to see all the variables names. Remember that if you want to see all the entries in something but python compresses it (so it doesn’t take up too much space), you can loop over it and print each item separately to make it show everything!</p> <p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> If you <em>do</em> print out all the variable names, please comment out the code before you submit your notebook so graders don’t end up swimming in print-outs.</p> <blockquote> <div><p>I’ll spare you the printout of all columns, but I got them with:</p> </div></blockquote> <div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class=highlight ><pre><span></span><span class=k >for</span> <span class=n >i</span> <span class=ow >in</span> <span class=n >wdi</span><span class=p >[</span><span class=s2 >"Indicator Name"</span><span class=p >]</span><span class=o >.</span><span class=n >value_counts</span><span class=p >()</span><span class=o >.</span><span class=n >index</span><span class=o >.</span><span class=n >sort_values</span><span class=p >():</span>

Come up with a strategy that gets our inequality variables as columns, and makes each of our future observations (i.e. each country-year) a row.</p> <p><em>Hint:</em> It can sometimes be helpful to drop useless columns before a reshape.</p> <p><em>Other hint:</em> Sometimes you will end up with your column names stored in a hierarchical (multi-level) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >.column</span></code> object structure. As with hierarchical indices for rows, they’re a pain. (Whether this occurs depends on the exact syntax you use, so you may or may not get it).</p> <p>The two easy ways to fix these hierarchical <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >.column</span></code> objects are:</p> <ul class=simple > <li><p>Just drop a level: df.columns.drop_level(0)` where 0 is which level you want to drop.</p> <li><p>Directly manipulate the column names by doing something to the df.columns object and re-assigning to df.columns. For example, you can just concatenate two columns levels (they’re stored as tuples) with a dash between them with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >df.columns</span> <span class=pre >=</span> <span class=pre >map(lambda</span> <span class=pre >x:</span> <span class=pre >str(x[0])</span> <span class=pre >+</span> <span class=pre >"-"</span> <span class=pre >+</span> <span class=pre >str(x[1]),</span> <span class=pre >df.columns)</span></code>.</p> </ul> <div class="nbinput nblast docutils container"> <div class="prompt highlight-none notranslate"><div class=highlight ><pre><span></span>[5]:

<br/></pre></div> </div> </div> <p><strong>(8)</strong> This analysis has allowed us to evaluate whether richer countries tend to have greater income inequality, but it certainly has not established whether we should expect that as countries become wealthier, their income distribution will also become more even. In other words, we have established a correlation between income inequality and wealth, but we certainly have not established a causal relationship between wealth and income inequality.</p> <p>One way we might be able to get better traction on this question is to look at whether, as individual countries become wealthier, their income distribution also becomes more even.</p> <p>To answer this question, let’s begin by subsetting our data to the years 2005 to 2015 (inclusive)—the period in which the largest number of countries in our data have inequality data. Then also subset for the set of countries with Gini data for all years in this period. This gives us what’s called a <em>balanced panel</em>—a dataset in which we have data on entities <em>at a number of different points in time</em> (a panel dataset) and where at every point in time, we have data for the <em>same set of entities</em> (a balanced panel dataset).</p> <p>Balanced panels are very desirable because the fact that they contain the same entities at all moments in time means that any changes we measure over time are the result of real changes in the outcomes we care about and <em>not</em> the result of changes in the composition of our sample.</p> <p>Store the number of countries still in your data in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >"ex8_countries_in_panel"</span></code>.</p> <div class="nbinput docutils container"> <div class="prompt highlight-none notranslate"><div class=highlight ><pre><span></span>[23]:
